        About
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our project is inspired by the brave soldiers who struggle with <strong>aphasia, PTSD, and other cognitive disorders</strong>. Many veterans and active-duty military personnel face difficulties expressing their experiences in words—whether due to trauma, neurological conditions, or speech impairments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are building a groundbreaking **brainwave-to-video** generation tool using **EEG headsets** and **Terra API's wearable data** to bridge this gap. By interpreting **real-time brain signals**, our system translates thoughts into **cohesive visual narratives**, allowing soldiers to express themselves beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>
        This technology offers a revolutionary way to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable soldiers with aphasia to communicate through AI-driven visuals.</li>
        <li>Help PTSD-affected veterans share their experiences in a non-verbal format.</li>
        <li>Enhance cognitive rehabilitation and mental health therapy for military personnel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are competing for the <strong>Terra Super Soldier (TSS) Program</strong> at the <strong>Healthcare Track Grand Prize</strong>. Our mission aligns perfectly with the challenge—to leverage **wearable data for performance enhancement and mental health support** in military applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using **brainwave data**, **AI**, and **video synthesis**, we aim to redefine communication for those who need it most. This is not just technology—it’s a new language for our heroes.
