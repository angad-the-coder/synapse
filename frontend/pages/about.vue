      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Our project is inspired by the brave soldiers who struggle with 
        <strong>aphasia, PTSD, and other cognitive disorders</strong>. 
        Many veterans and active-duty military personnel face difficulties 
        expressing their experiences in words—whether due to trauma, neurological conditions, or speech impairments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are building a groundbreaking <strong>brainwave-to-video</strong> generation tool using 
        <strong>EEG headsets</strong> and <strong>Terra API's wearable data</strong> to bridge this gap. 
        By interpreting <strong>real-time brain signals</strong>, our system translates thoughts into 
        <strong>cohesive visual narratives</strong>, allowing soldiers to express themselves beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>This technology offers a revolutionary way to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable soldiers with aphasia to communicate through AI-driven visuals.</li>
        <li>Help PTSD-affected veterans share their experiences in a non-verbal format.</li>
        <li>Enhance cognitive rehabilitation and mental health therapy for military personnel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are competing for the <strong>Terra Super Soldier (TSS) Program</strong> 
        at the <strong>Healthcare Track Grand Prize</strong>. Our mission aligns perfectly with the challenge—
        to leverage <strong>wearable data for performance enhancement and mental health support</strong> 
        in military applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using <strong>brainwave data</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and <strong>video synthesis</strong>, 
        we aim to redefine communication for those who need it most. This is not just technology—
        it’s a new language for our heroes.
